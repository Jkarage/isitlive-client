# Isitlive client

This is a client that can be used to test for liveness of machines.

## Usage

Put your server domain name or IP instead of Tausi Africa

``` bash
    go run main.go tausi.africa
```

### Accepts multiple machines

``` bash

go run main.go google.com afropavoanalytics.com

```

This works hand in hand with the server that sends message and email to verified accounts for notifications
